In this exercise we cover both intensity-based and feature-based registration. There are different folders and subfolders 
that you need to check. When going through the notebooks, you will see the missing parts that you need to complete.
Sample images that you need to work with the data is saved in the `data/` folder.

Specifically, you need to check these notebooks:

- intensity-based:

    - `intensity-Registration.ipynb`
    - `SITK registration/SITK_registration.ipynb`
    - `US-CT registration/US-CT_registration.ipynb`
    
- feature-based:
  
    - `Exercise-Feature-Registration.ipynb`

In the lecture session, we will go through these notebook files and quickly explain each one.
